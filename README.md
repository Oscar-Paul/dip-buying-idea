Here's a very simple dip-buying idea. 

When your money is locked up in an asset, you can't buy a different asset. What if you were able to buy an asset when you knew it was likely to perform, and sell it when you expected it not to? 

Weekly intervals were used to simplify out considerations like overnight/premarket, slippage, fees, timezones, etc. 

I leave this simple code with lots of room for optimisation towards whatever goal one might have (e.g. optimising for sharpe, kelly criterion, finding which companiess perform at x% drop, finding which %drop leads to x company performing, e.t.c)
